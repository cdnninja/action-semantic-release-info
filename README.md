# GitHub Action - Get Next Semantic Release Info
This GitHub Action gets next semantic release info, does not publish. export the info as output variables.

## Usage

Add this step in your workflow file
```yaml
- name: Gets semantic release info
  id: semantic_release_info
  uses: jossef/action-semantic-release-info@v3.0.0
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

### Output Variables

- `type` - The part of the version incremented - major/minor/patch
- `channel` - The distribution channel on which the last release was initially made available
- `git_head` - The sha of the last commit being part of the release
- `version` - The version of the release
- `git_tag` - The Git tag associated with the release
- `name` - The name of the release
- `notes` - The release notes of the release (a summary of git commits)

output variables can be accessed after the step is completed via 
```
${{ steps.semantic_release_info.outputs.<variable name> }}
```

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - '**'
    tags-ignore:
      - '*.*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            
      - name: Gets semantic release info
        id: semantic_release_info

        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
